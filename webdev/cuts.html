                  <h5>FarmSense is a web platform that serves as an agricltural repository, that provides access to information which will drive agriculture investment and
                     opportunity across community by allowing public stakeholder have access to information presented visualization and analysis to foster positive decision making
                    </h5>  
                  <h5>This portal was established because the industry’s information needs were not fully serviced. Accurate,
                     complete and timely information is absolutely essential to the industry’s decisions makers at various levels. 
                     In addition, from the engagement we had with our local individual farmers and some cooperative agencies, 
                     they all agreed that they want a platform to project their activities, get informed on best practices, also access opportunities and investors within the sector.</h5> <br>
                  <h5>This project was funded by YouthMappers co-founding administrative team at Texas Tech University, 
                    West Virginia University and The George Washington University with funding support provided by the United States Agency for International Development through the USAID GeoCenter,
                     Award #AID-OAA-G-15-00007. eHealth Africa Team, provided technical support inorder to make the project a success.</h5> 
                     
                     <b> <h5>Expected output /outcome:</h5></b>
                       <h6>At the end of this research, we will be creating an open data set on agriculture that has never been created in Nigeria.
                          The agricultural portal will be a web based platform, and as time goes on we aim to develop a mobile app to send alerts in forms of notifications to everyone that have the app installed.</h6>  
                       
                     <h6><li>Within a year, we expect to see farm produce in Ondo state increase by 30% in Ondo State. This increase will be driven by capable youths.</li>  
                      <li>The platform to be created will serve to help farmers with the relevant information they need to work more efficiently.</li>
                      <li>The public will be better informed about the Agriculture sector and subsequently see opportunities for investment. This will open up the agriculture sector in Nigeria to innovation.</li>
                      <li>Growth in the sector would invariably mean more jobs, businesses and economic growth.</li>
                      <li> Overall, this will prove the relevance of open geospatial technology and open data to spur an economical resilient population</li>
